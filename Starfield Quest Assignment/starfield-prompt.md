# Starfield Hyperspace Effect Prompt

Create an interactive starfield webpage that simulates the lightspeed/hyperspace travel effect from Star Wars.

## Core Requirements

- Stars should originate from the center of the screen and travel outward toward the edges, creating the illusion that the viewer is traveling through space at high speed
- Each star should have a trailing effect behind it (like motion blur or light streaks)
- The effect should be full-screen and immersive

## Controls

- Include a slider in the top-right corner of the screen that allows the user to adjust the length of the star trails
- The slider should update the effect in real-time

## Visual Style

- Dark space background
- Stars should glow and feel dynamic
- Smooth, continuous animation
- The overall aesthetic should evoke the feeling of jumping to lightspeed
