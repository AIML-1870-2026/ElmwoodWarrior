They call me the Elmwood Warrior.

Most people think it’s an ironic nickname. They think it’s funny that I walk home alone through the worst part of town. They don't know about the years I spent in training halls where the sweat slicked the floor like ice, or the discipline instilled in me by instructors who didn't believe in second chances.

They don't know that I don't walk Elmwood Park Rd because I'm crazy. I walk it because I’m the most dangerous thing on it.

It was 1:00 AM. The fog was clinging to the pavement, obscuring the potholes and the roots cracking through the asphalt. I could hear the city breathing in the distance, but here, on this stretch of road, it was dead silent.

My boots hit the ground with a heavy, rhythmic thud. I wasn’t walking with a "commuter's pace." I was moving with a patrol cadence. Head on a swivel. Shoulders loose. Hands out of my pockets, ready to snap from relaxed to combat-ready in a quarter of a second.

I saw them waiting by the weeping willow about fifty yards out. Four of them.

They weren't just kids loitering. I could tell by their posture—tight, coiled, aggressive—that they were looking for trouble. They saw a lone figure and did the math. They thought four against one was a guarantee.

I didn't slow down. I analyzed.

Target One (Center): The leader. Big, confident, stepping forward to initiate. Target Two (Left): Fast, light on his feet. The flanker. Targets Three and Four: Muscle. Standing back to cut off the escape.

I didn't deviate my line by an inch. I walked straight toward the center of the road where they had formed a wall.

"End of the line, pal," Target One said. He stepped into my personal space, puffing his chest out, trying to use his size to intimidate. "Give us the bag."

I stopped three feet from him. The perfect engagement distance.

I didn't say a word. I just looked at him. I let my eyes go dead—that thousand-yard stare that usually makes people realize they’ve made a mistake. I wasn't looking at his face; I was watching his shoulders, waiting for the telegraph.

"You deaf?" he shouted, reaching out to shove me.

Mistake.

The second his hand moved, I executed.

I didn't panic; I reacted. My left hand shot out, parrying his arm to the side. I used his own forward momentum against him, stepping in and sweeping his lead leg.

Gravity took over. He hit the asphalt with a heavy thud, the wind knocked out of him instantly.

Target Two rushed me from the left, swinging a wild haymaker. I ducked under the punch—simple, efficient movement—and grabbed him by the collar and belt. With a pivot of my hips, I executed a perfect hip toss. He went airborne, landing flat on his back next to his leader.

I stood there, breathing evenly, looking at the two remaining guys—the muscle.

I cracked my neck. Then I settled into a stance—hands open, center of gravity low, balanced. I wasn't breathing hard. I was just getting warmed up.

"Next," I said. My voice was calm, controlled, and absolute.

The two standing guys looked at their friends groaning on the ground, struggling to get their breath back. They looked at my stance—the technical perfection of it. They realized they weren't looking at a victim. They were looking at a professional.

They backed up, hands raised, shaking their heads. They grabbed their friends, helping them limp away into the bushes, disappearing into the dark of the park.

I straightened my jacket. I checked my pulse—barely elevated.

I stepped back onto the center line of the road and continued my walk. A block later, a police cruiser rolled by slowly. The officer looked at me, saw the way I walked—shoulders back, unbothered, disciplined—and gave me a nod. He knew.

I am the Elmwood Warrior. And this is my road.
